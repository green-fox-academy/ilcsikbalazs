# Write a program that asks for 5 integers in a row,
# then it should print the sum and the average of these numbers like:
#
# Sum: 22, Average: 4.4
i1 = input()
i2 = input()
i3 = input()
i4 = input()
i5 = input()

sum_numbers = i1 + i2 + i3 + i4 + i5
avg_numbers = sum_numbers / 5
print(sum_numbers)
print(avg_numbers)
